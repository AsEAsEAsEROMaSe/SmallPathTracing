Minimum path trace test, with camera.
Created using an open repository.
It was based on the tracing of the path and the SFML library.
This library allows you to display images using opengl.
The project implants a general control camera and a local beam generation camera.
The general camera copies its basic parameters to the camera trace which creates rays based on the last stable values
of the main camera. Works with two threads. 
The number of processing streams can be increased.
